                <p>my professional opinion on ai ethics</p>

                <hr>

                <h2 id="openingStatement">ai: it's what everybody is talking about now.</h2>
                <p>from writing a mean essay to making images that child predators will like on facebook,
                it has boomed in popularity recently through LLMs (large language models) like chatgpt
                and it's now being integrated into computers, operating systems, web browsers, etc through stuff like
                copilot, apple intellegence, aria etc<br>
                i am going to state my opinions on ai being used for creative stuff like art and writing</p>

                <h2 id="writing">writing</h2>
                <p>ai can write essays, poems, and more based off other writing through human prompts</p>
                <img src="../images/blog/Screenshot 2025-04-21 202932.png" class="blogImage">
                <p>i'm pretty qualified to talk about this since i write a lot so uhh<br>
                the closest ai will get to my writing is me asking stuff like "is it good" and getting advice
                and stuff<br>
                if i gave it a prompt and told it to write my ideas for me and then said that i made it would be
                dishonest and undignified<br>
                it would show that i didn't care enough to actually do it myself and that i'm a liar<br>
                it doesn't matter if the idea was original, actually writing it yourself is the proper display of skills
                like grammar, vocabulary, etc and if that's hard for you i'm sorry but i just think that's how it is<br>
                you could use ai as a learning opportunity and ask it to rate and give you advice on your writing<br>
                i do that<br>
                and it works<br>
                and that's creative writing, which is what i mainly do</p>
                <h3 id="writing-academic">academic</h3>
                <p><b>turning in unedited ai generated writing as your own creation is academic misconduct.</b>
                most professors and teachers agree with that statement<br>
                a lot of them fear students will use ai to complete assignments with zero effort, bypassing the thinking, 
                intellectual struggle, and learning involved in an assignment<br>
                and i think that's a fair concern<br>
                what i also think is fair is ai as a writing assistant in some cases<br>
                like researching when googling won't give you answers or asking about the quality of your writing</p>

                <h2 id="art">art</h2>
                <p>ai can generate cohesive images based off other ones through human prompts</p>
                <img src="../images/blog/Screenshot 2025-04-21 213041.png" class="blogImage">
                <p>this is even more controversial i think and i'm not really qualified to speak here<br>
                and to me this brings up question along the lines of<br>
                what gives art its value?<br>
                it's certainly not like how good the art looks to people<br>
                stuff like a random old sketch or a literal blank canvas with a funny title can sell for fortunes<br>
                i think it could be the message it brings<br>
                going back to the blank canvas, if it's title was like "give me the money" it would symbolize how stupid
                art can get when it comes to value<br>
                if someone was like "i put hours into this" and specifically stated what they made wasn't ai when it really
                was then that would be undignified<br>
                but when it's like they had the idea and put it in a prompt i really don't know<br>
                i can say it's kinda not ok with writing because proper display of skills and stuff<br>
                and with that logic it could be the same here like<br>
                the idea is one thing but showing the other skills that go into making art like drawing, coloring, etc is the
                complete goal<br>
                i really don't know, but it could be that art isn't just about having an idea, it's about being able to
                realize that idea in a meaningful way.<br>
                like, are you low on resources? use what you've got. that could mean making an art piece out of like
                pieces of log. it's still art, and it'll make your art piece way more meaningful as well.</p>

                <h2 id="music">music</h2>
                <p>ai can generate music based off other music through human prompts</p>
                <img src="../images/blog/Screenshot 2025-04-21 214748.png" class="blogImage">
                <p>i don't really know what to say here but<br>
                is this even worth it? most ai music i've heard is repetitive and just samey<br>
                i don't think anyone actually would like get ai music and be like "guys i made this myself isnt it so cool!1!!??"<br>
                could it really ever be truly expressive?<br>
                people like to say they like music with 'soul.'<br>
                ai can't really achieve that, no?<br>
                i don't know</p>

                <h2 id="programming">programming</h2>
                <p>ai can write code based off documentation and previously written code through human prompts</p>
                <img src="../images/blog/Screenshot 2025-04-21 220711.png" class="blogImage">
                <p>i am a bit qualified to talk about this, i program stuff<br>
                i think letting ai write some code for you is completely fine<br>
                i do it a lot because programming is quite often confusing<br>
                when you're programming, you can't really do anything meaningful unless you know what you're doing<br>
                so if i ask chatgpt to give me some code i can use i'm going to have to understand what it has just written<br>
                otherwise i'll just have a block of code that i don't understand and that's not good when bugs start popping up<br>
                so yeah i think it's completely fine because of the nature of programming</p>

                <h2 id="generalEthics">general ethics</h2>
                <p>there are different ethical concerns depending on how ai is used, and i will list some of the biggest ones:</p>
                <h3 id="generalEthics-rCaP">rights, consent, and plagiarism</h3>
                <p>here's an example:<br>
                most ai art models are trained on huge amounts of data that have artwork from human artists, often without asking
                for permission<br>
                if an ai learns by viewing someone's work without credit or compensation it raises questions about exploitation<br>
                you could argue it's similar to how humans learn; by observing, imitating, and remixing<br>
                but humans have boundaries like copyright laws and ai models don't always respect that<br>
                some outputs can mimic existing media so closely they can blur the line between inspiration and copying</p>
                <h3 id="generalEthics-jobDisplacement">job displacement</h3>
                <p>something many people fear is that ai and machinery will take their jobs<br>
                one example is like horses and cars<br>
                sure it's not like we would pay horses or anything but like i'm pretty sure we took care of them most of the time and
                then cars came and horses in their entirety were no longer needed<br>
                same thing with ai<br>
                people fear their jobs will be taken in the same way<br>
                ideally to avoid job displacement we should keep ai as a tool and not a replacement in my opinion</p>
                <h3 id="generalEthics-accessibility">accessibility</h3>
                <p>ai gives people the ability to express their creative ideas without traditional langauge, artistic, musical, 
                etc training.<br>
                people who couldn't do some creative activites before can now<br>
                but as i've stated before, that training does tend to matter<br>
                if you can make something with knowing how, does it count as art?<br>
                you could say yes, because art is just about if not more about ideas as much as technique<br>
                but you could also say no, because art is about intentional choices and those require skill.<br>
                so i'm not sure where i stand here.<br>
                maybe if ai is just a tool and you're using it with your own purpose, knowledge, and vision, you're still the creator<br>
                but if it's doing the thinking and creating for you, then i would argue you are not the creator.</p>

                <h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2>
                <p>this stuff is like philosophically challenging to think about<br>
                does learning the craft still matter when ai can do it for you?<br>
                i think so<br>
                but i could just as easily say i don't.</p>
