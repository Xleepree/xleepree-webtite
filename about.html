            <p><i>Describe yourself (100 char. limit) "a person"</i></p>
            <hr>
            <p>i'm xleepree<br>
            <br>
            my name is diego and i do stuff:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>existing</li>
                    <li>going to public school</li>
                    <li>coding</li>
                    <li>playing videogames like terraria, subnautica, roblox, etc.</li>
                    <li>other things that people do</li>
                </ul>
            <p>i'm intrested in creative writing, astronomy/sciences in general, and coding (note: i wanted to be an astronaut at one point)<br>
            for examples, i've written like 20 chapter stories only to abandon them because i thought they weren't good enough,<br>
            watch or read scientific videos and articles every single day and have been for years,<br>
            and i'm in the process of learning to code (hint: check my projects)<br>
            <br>
            my family is from the dominican republic and immigrated to the US<br>
            i was born in the US but my parents and my sister were not so i'm dominican<br>
            me and my sister get a better education in result of being in this country<br>
            we go back to DR for vacations now<br>
            <br>
            in case you're wondering where i am in programming, i know:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>html</li>
                    <li>css</li>
                    <li>javascript</li>
                    <li>python: it's basically english. idk what to use it for tho</li>
                    <li>a bit about C-like languages</li>
                    <li>astro, kind of? (haven't used it for anything except like one thing i'm working on)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>trying to focus on javascript because of shiny object syndrome<br>
                turns out trying to learn more than one language at once to "expand your knowledge" is hard and overall does not give you progress<br>
                in the end you would just perform poorly in each language<br>
                so instead what i'm doing is focusing on javascript to learn essential concepts so i can learn other langauges easier<br>
                <br>
                anyway yeah<br>
                that's me i guess</p>
