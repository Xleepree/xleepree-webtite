            <p>Hello there, and let me introduce myself. I'm Diego.<br>
            Online I go by <i>xleepree</i>. I:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Exist</li>
                <li>Go to school</li>
                <li>Write</li>
                <li>Code</li>
                <li>Draw, I guess</li>
                <li>Play videogames</li>
                <li>Do other things that regular people of my age do</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My passions, I guess that's what you could call them, is creative writing, astronomy and science in general, and coding.<br>
            I wanted to be an astronaut at one point. Those days are gone, though.<br>
            I'm writing a novel. I do some digital art (as well as physical art, obviously) and I've been learning how to
            program since late 2024.<br>
            My current standing in my programming knowledge is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>web development (HTML, CSS)</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>Python but I do not use it very often</li>
                <li>Astro, Svelte</li>
                <li>Electron, Tauri, Neutralinojs</li>
                <li>Rust</li>

            </ul>
            <p>I try to focus on one thing to learn at a time. I will most likely just retain less information if I try to learn too many
            things at once.<br>
            <br>
            And, yeah. That is me.</p>
