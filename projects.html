                    number clicker is a Cookie Clicker type game where you click a box and a number goes up. It's
                    not that fun to me, but neither is Cookie Clicker either. I started it in early 2025 for fun.<br>
                    As of now, major version v1.0.0 has released. The releases are in the
                    <a href="https://github.com/Xleepree/number-clicker">GitHub repo</a>.

                    pwamaker is a CLI tool for making PWAs (Progressive Web Apps) quickly on Windows, macOS,
                    and Linux. It is built using Rust and the PWAs are built using wry. It builds the source
                    for a PWA and puts it in someone's downloads folder. In addition, it optionally creates
                    binaries like .exe for Windows, .dmg for macOS, and  .deb/.AppImage/.tar.xz for Linux,
                    so it can be used as a real app. <small>(NOTE: this functionality has not been
                    released yet)</small>

                <p>
                    cool sandbox game is a Roblox sandbox physics game that me and <a href="https://taxevaiden.pages.dev">taxevaiden</a>
                    worked on in 2024. I did soundtrack and building while taxevaiden did all of the scripting and related things.<br>
                    And then we stopped working on it. Later on taxevaiden started to work on a 2D version made in C# that was discontinued.<br>
                    Then, recently he tried making something in Roblox again, and I... don't know what happened. Never got to work on it. Then
                    even more recently he was talking about making something reminiscent of cool sandbox game with C++ and I think he's working
                    on it. I really don't know.
