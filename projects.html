                <p>originally, cool sandbox game was a roblox sandbox physics game that me and
                <a href="https://taxevaiden.pages.dev">taxevaiden</a> worked on, me doing music and building
                while he does scripting and some other stuffs (play it <a href="https://roblox.com/games/11412644695/cool-sandbox-game">here</a>)<br>
                then we stopped working on it<br>
                then taxevaiden started to work on a 2d version made with C# and some other stuff<br>
                i don't know if he's working on it anymore but he probably isn't which is fine</p>
