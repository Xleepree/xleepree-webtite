                    <p>microsoft: it's a corporation. one of the largest corporations in existence, actually. they also have bill gates<br>
                    it's part of my life through: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the operating system i use (windows 11)</li>
                        <li>office/dev software i use like word and visual studio code</li>
                        <li>flight simulator (yes, really)</li>
                        <li>github</li>
                        <li>most likely a lot of other things microsoft does (They do a lot of things.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>so i'm using their stuff often<br>
                    ..i have some things to say</p>

                    <h2 id="blog1">things that are nice</h2>
                    <h3 id="blog1-sub1">visual studio code, github, npm, etc</h3>
                    <p>vsc is the code editor i use to code. i like it. I don't really have any complaints. it's good especially with features like extensions<br>
                    github is where i put my code and host my website/other stuff<br>
                    npm is a javascript thing<br>
                    microsoft has nice developer stuff and softwares I guess</p>
                    <h3 id="blog1-sub2">microsoft word</h3>
                    <p>word is what i use to write. it's a pretty normal, standard office editor but it's a lot better than google docs<br>
                    i like being able to have eyes at night. Docs doesn't have a dark mode. Word does. I like that. also, I have more control of what I'm writing.<br>
                    One issue, though. <b>MICROSOFT OFFICE SOFTWARE COSTS A FORTUNE.</b> <small>My actual ownership of the software is... <i>questionable.</i></small></p>
                    <h3 id="blog1-sub3">microsoft flight simulator</h3>
                    <p>it's a flight sim game. now, I'm really not that into it i don;t even have a flightstick and that stuff but honestly i just find it fun<br>
                    even if all i have is an xbox controller but, Oh well.</p>

                    <h2 id="blog2">things that <i>aren't</i> nice</h2>
                    <h3 id="blog2-sub1">windows (11)</h3>
                    <p>windows is a buggy mess now and i hate it so much. If I could use anything else, MacOS, Linux, anything, with the same compatibility, 
                    I would use it. When it was first released, the hardware requirements were so stupid it was like Vista. It was buggy, but that happens on 
                    release. However, it's STILL A MESS. and guess what they decide to do? they start to kill of windows 10. End of support is late this year. 
                    and we're all going to be stuck with a messy 11. Also, bloatware is a problem. also recently, with ai stuff. Copilot and ads are being shoved down our 
                    throats, so that's lovely.<br>
                    Windows 11 is a problem.</p>
                    <h3 id="blog2-sub2">copilot ai being shoved down our throats</h3>
                    <p>microsoft is forcing its ai thing copilot and ads into all of its software and hardware. All the new laptops and stuff have that goddamn Copilot 
                    button. It's being intergrated into Windows (forcibly,) and I don't want it. i don't care about it.</p>

                    <h2 id="blog3">i'm annoyed</h2>
                    <p>word and vsc is cool but<br>
                    Microsoft, you need to get your act together with Windows. Windows specifically. People are losing patience.<br>
                    We've had 11 since what, 2021? Why is it still buggy? Are you kidding me? WHY IS IT SO BAD? People are saying they are 'upgrading' to 10. 
                    They've been saying that, but it shows what people think of 11.<br>
                    A buggy mess.</p>
