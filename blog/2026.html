                		Happy New Year.<br>
					<i>2020 was 6 years ago.<br>
					2018 was 8 years ago.</i><br>
					I can't wrap my head around that. It feels impossible. But it's real, so that brings us to the question:<br>
					How was 2025?

                		In 2025, I believe I really got to recognize my skills. I started writing the novel. 
                    I learned to program. I learned new art techniques and developed my own art style.
                </p>

                <p>
                		Old me from late 2024 would've never envisioned how far I've gotten in programming skills. 
                		Or the sheer amount words I would write in the novel from April to July.<br>
                    <br>
                    I also developed my own musical taste at around the same time I started the novel. Before, 
                    I didn't really listen to music or have a playlist or anything. Now I do.

                <p>
                    I also did a lot of screwery with tech which was a learning expierence. 
                    I tried to turn my old iMac into a home server over the summer for about 2 weeks. 
                    It failed. I learned about Linux and open-source software. 
                    Now I use LibreOffice and VSCode and my laptop's OS is Linux.

                <h3 id="blog1-2">the bad</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2025, a certain person entered a very important office. Their actions 
                    caused problems for my parents (especially my mother) and it's made them 
                    consider returning to the Dominican Republic.<br>
					Which sucks, because as much as I dislike what's happening, 
                    (that) country is home for me. I was born there and live there.<br>
                    <br>
                    The AI "bubble" (or whatever it is, really) is getting more and more noticeable 
                    and also quite annoying to me. AI slop content genuinely makes my blood boil 
                    every time I see it. I don't want to see it.<br>					There's these ambiance videos on YouTube that are literally AI Inception: AI 
                    video on top of an AI audio (also with AI lyrics in some cases) and AI title... 
                    it goes on. It's all generated, and people fall for it.
                </p>

                <h2 id="blog2">so what now?</h2>
                <p>
                		I'm not done learning. I'll keep writing the novel, getting better at programming, 
                    and practicing my art skills. And I want to learn new skills, too. I was able 
                    to learn how to program so quickly, why can't I do that with something else?<br>					<br>
					2025 was more than bearable. And I have a feeling 2026 will be even better. 
                    	For me, and hopefully you too.
