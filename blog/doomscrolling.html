                <p>
                    It's 2 in the morning. Instead of sleeping, you've got your phone clutched in your palm.<br>
                    The pixels you can see on your phone screen entertain you, like putting your brain on autopilot.<br>
                    In your head, you tell yourself you should go to sleep soon. You've been telling yourself that for hours.<br>
                    Every short little video makes you want another. And it is designed to do that.<br>
                    <br>
                    This is <b>doomscrolling.</b> Coined around 2018, it means spending excessive amounts of time watching 
                    digital content, usually short-form.<br>
                    You probably do it. I do it too. It's not our fault, though. Not really.<br>
                </p>

                <h2 id="blog1">screen time...</h2>
                <p>
                    Do you set screen time limits? I <i>try</i> to.<br>
                    However, they don't really help when you can just... ignore them. They're more like screen time reminders.<br>
                    My screen time yesterday was 6 hours and 7 minutes. <small>i promise you that's unintentional</small> That's bad enough.<br>
                    <b>I spent 91% of that time scrolling on social media.</b>
                </p>
                <img src="../asset/images/blog/content/doomscrolling/1.jpeg" style="margin-bottom: -3px">
                <p><small>Graph from iOS Screen Time</small></p>
                <p>
                    This is extremely unhealthy. And I know it. Every time I get up and put my phone down, I feel miserable. 
                    <i>I just did nothing for 3 hours straight.</i><br>
                    I could have spent that time being productive, working on my projects, the novel, my schoolwork. But I didn't,
                    because watching TikTok was easier.
                </p>

                <h2 id="blog2">why do we even do this</h2>
                <h3 id="blog2-1">the design of social media apps</h3>
                <p>
                    TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram, whatever. These are all applications with a business model that relies
                    on user engagement. The longer you're on the app, you see more advertisements and more data about you is collected.
                    Emotionally-charged content being pushed to you makes you spend even more time on the app.<br>
                    In the end, this becomes profit for social media companies.<br>
                    <br>
                    With this incentive, social media companies deliberately design their apps to be engaging as possible. Algorithims
                    prioritize content that is emotionally stimulating to keep users scrolling. Social media companies have no
                    reason to not do this, because your mental health is not their problem.
                </p>

                <h3 id="blog2-2">we are attracted to negativity</h3>
                <p>
                    Due to evolution, negativity has a larger impact on the human brain than positivity. In prehistoric times,
                    humans sought out negativity and were drawn to it because often, this negativity was something that could hurt us
                    physically. It helps to know how a creature or other danger can hurt you.<br>
                    <br>
                    In the modern day, these dangers are effectively absent in daily life for most people. To scratch this itch that
                    has been wired into us, we unknowingly seek out negative news.<br>
                    This is how algorithims prioritizing negative news keeps you engaged for longer. And this... this is business,
                    whether you like it or not.
                </p>
                <h3 id="blog2-3">FOMO & control</h3>
                <p>
                    The fear of missing out on crucial negative info can lead to doomscrolling. A rapidly-evolving news story can
                    cause you to keep looking at social media, to see what's new. It may not be beneficial to you, but you need
                    to stay informed, no?<br>
                    <br>
                    During uncertain times, you are likely going to doomscroll so you can stay up-to-date, granting you a sense 
                    of preparedness. This fulfills a psychological need for control.
                </p>

                <h3 id="blog2-4">laziness?</h3>
                <p>
                    While there are many uncontrollable factors that can lead to doomscrolling, one could just be tired, or lazy.<br>
                    When everything else one could do requires effort, even if minimal, their phone is there, next to them. Where one
                    can just open TikTok and scroll.<br>
                    Scrolling social media is easy, but just as entertaining if not more than doing other things, like playing videogames.
                    You don't even have to think, really. Unlike a videogame, no challenge, no thinking is needed. Real world activities
                    (obviously) demand that you move, which... can be tough for someone low on energy.<br>
                    <br>
                    And so, there is your phone. The most low effort, high reward activity. But it doesn't feel so rewarding after
                    you've been doing it for hours, doesn't it?<br>
                    <br>
                    This is the main reason <i>I</i> doomscroll. Basically, I'm just a bum. But now you can see, why wouldn't someone
                    want to doomscroll? Not foreseeing that they will be doing it for hours, it's quick, no-effort entertainment. 
                </p>

                <h2 id="blog3">symptoms: i'm miserable</h2>
                <p>
                    Every time I doomscroll, I feel miserable. You probably do too. Sitting in your bed for hours scrolling on your phone
                    isn't something to be proud of. It really isn't.<br>
                    Doomscrolling is clinically proven to generally worsen mental health. Don't get me started on attention spans. We all
                    know about that stuff, and being compared to goldfish...<br>
                    <br>
                    Doomscrolling also impacts people with existing psychological issues, and usually more strongly. It can exacerbate
                    anxiety, depression, and loneliness.
                </p>

                <h2 id="blog4">what to do</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm going to be honest: I don't know. I am no medical professional. However, it can help to delete social media apps if possible.<br>
                    But you could just reinstall them. Just like screen time limits, deleting your apps can be reversed pretty easily.<br>
                    You just need to break out of the habit. Add as many obstacles as possible to doomscrolling. Give yourself an incentive to not
                    doomscroll. Soon, you'll probably be done with it.
                </p>

                <p><small>Consider removing TikTok, for example.</small></p>
                <p>
                    I mean, that's just what I say though. I haven't actually done that.<br>
                    I'm trying to find my way out of here too.
